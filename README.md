Vendors/Developers
----
The device vendors/ROM developers are free to include Amaze apk pre-installed in system. There is no fee required; *but you must comply with the license* (for more information read the [GNU GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or newer).

We strongly recommend using apk signed by us (either Play Store version or from AFH link above) so that users would be able to update directly from Play Store after distribution. Furthermore, a change in digital signature will break plug-ins.

### License: 
Amaze File Utilities is licenced under [GPLv3](https://teamamaze.xyz/license-agreement-utilities) and anyone wanting to use it (as a base for your own project or even use some of its parts or features) has to adhere to this license completely. Make sure that you are aware of all the licensing terms before creating your own project based on Amaze Utilities.

Here some important points to keep in mind, as to how we handle licensing:

- You cannot simply rename our app, strip it of all credit and upload it anywhere as your own, be this with or without monetization.
- You have to make changes in terms of design, features, etc before publishing it anywhere. Changing app name, package name and logo is not enough.
- You are required to give us full credits for any work you may be using from us.
- We will ALWAYS use all our legal options, if you do not strictly adhere to these licencing terms.
